# OW Camera Remote

A very simple camera timer remote app for Pebble Watches.

Set the countdown timer and pose for your great photo away from your phone.

Check it out on [Pebble Apps](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57542b7f70c28c587d000004)!

Relies on a companion app, [OW Camera for Pebble](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.jamsinclair.owcamera), for photo taking from Android phone. The companion app is a modified clone of the great [Open Camera](http://opencamera.sourceforge.net) app.

## History

Hastily hacked app together over two weekends.... 6 months apart.

I like to make things that I will use. I often travel solo and wanted a way to take pictures of myself in different locations away from my phone using a remote or timer.

## Disclaimer

I shoddily put this app together for myself and are releasing to the public in case anyone else finds this useful. I am unlikely to update this project at all and will not offer any support.
